    <h2>About Algeria</h2>
    <p>
      Algeria, officially known as the People‚Äôs Democratic Republic of Algeria, is the largest country in Africa, stretching across 2.38 million square kilometers. Located in North Africa, it shares borders with Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Western Sahara, and Morocco, while also enjoying a long Mediterranean coastline. Much of the country is dominated by the mighty Sahara Desert, which covers nearly 80% of its territory. The northern coastal plain and the Atlas Mountains, however, provide fertile land for agriculture and are home to most of the population. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Algeria is long and complex. Ancient Berber tribes were its earliest inhabitants, followed by the influence of Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, and later Arab-Muslim conquests in the 7th century, which introduced Islam and Arabic culture. In the 16th century, Algeria became part of the Ottoman Empire before falling under French colonial rule in 1830. French domination lasted for more than 130 years until Algeria‚Äôs independence in 1962 after a fierce liberation war led by the National Liberation Front (FLN). The struggle for freedom is remembered as one of the most significant anti-colonial movements of the 20th century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Algeria is a presidential republic where politics have often been influenced by its liberation history and powerful military. The country has witnessed social movements such as the 2019 Hirak protests, which demanded democratic reforms and political transparency. Despite challenges, Algeria plays a vital role in the African Union, Arab League, and Mediterranean partnerships. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Economically, Algeria is rich in natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas, which account for the majority of government revenues and export earnings. It is one of the largest natural gas exporters to Europe. However, the heavy reliance on hydrocarbons has also created vulnerabilities, with fluctuations in global oil prices directly impacting the economy. In recent years, the government has been attempting to diversify into agriculture, renewable energy, and tourism. Agriculture is important in the northern regions, producing wheat, barley, citrus fruits, olives, and dates, while traditional markets continue to thrive in rural areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algerian culture is a vibrant blend of Arab, Berber, African, and Mediterranean traditions. The majority of the population identifies as Arab-Berber, and Islam is the state religion, deeply shaping daily life, festivals, and values. The Amazigh (Berber) identity has been officially recognized, with Tamazight declared a national language alongside Arabic. French is also widely used, a legacy of colonial times, especially in education and business. Music plays a big role in cultural expression, with Ra√Ø, Chaabi, and Andalusian styles being popular both locally and internationally. Algerian cuisine reflects this diversity‚Äîcouscous, chorba, mechoui (roast lamb), and dates are central, while mint tea and strong coffee are everyday staples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Algeria‚Äôs climate is equally diverse. The north enjoys a Mediterranean climate with warm summers and mild, rainy winters, making it ideal for agriculture. In contrast, the vast Sahara is dry and harsh, with extreme temperatures and dramatic landscapes that attract adventurous travelers. Oases scattered across the desert support date palm cultivation and traditional nomadic lifestyles. Tourism is growing steadily, with UNESCO World Heritage sites like the ancient city of Timgad, the M‚Äôzab Valley, and the Casbah of Algiers showcasing Algeria‚Äôs historical and architectural treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite challenges such as unemployment, economic dependency on hydrocarbons, and political transitions, Algeria remains a nation of resilience and pride. Its rich history, diverse landscapes, and cultural depth make it a fascinating part of Africa and the Arab world, standing as a bridge between the Mediterranean and the Sahara.
