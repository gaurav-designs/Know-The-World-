    <!-- Geography -->
    <button class="accordion">Geography üåè</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Bangladesh is a South Asian country bordered by India and Myanmar, with a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is predominantly a low-lying deltaic region with fertile plains formed by the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. The landscape includes rivers, wetlands, mangrove forests such as the Sundarbans, and some hilly areas in the southeast. The geography contributes to rich biodiversity but also exposes the country to flooding and cyclones. Fertile soil and river systems make Bangladesh ideal for agriculture, supporting rice, jute, sugarcane, tea, and vegetables. Its geographic location influences trade, transportation, and climate. The river networks are vital for inland navigation and water resources, while natural hazards shape settlement and disaster management strategies.</p>

Urbanization and migration influence labor markets, economic development, and regional planning. Population trends play a central role in policy-making and national priorities.</p>
