        India, located in South Asia, is the seventh-largest country in the world and the second most populous. Its geography is incredibly diverse, spanning the towering Himalayan mountains in the north, fertile plains along the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers, arid deserts in the west, and tropical coastlines along the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. The northern Himalayas contain some of the world's highest peaks, glaciers, and river systems that provide water for millions of people. Central India is dominated by the Deccan Plateau with rich soils and mineral deposits. The western arid regions, like the Thar Desert, experience extreme temperatures and scarce rainfall. Coastal plains and southern peninsulas host tropical forests, wetlands, and fertile agricultural lands. India has over 2,900 kilometers of coastline and numerous rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that support irrigation, hydroelectric power, and trade. The diverse terrain shapes climate, agriculture, and biodiversity, influencing the livelihoods and culture of people across regions. From tropical rainforests in the northeast to alpine meadows in the north, India‚Äôs geography is a source of natural wealth and strategic advantage, contributing to its economic, cultural, and ecological diversity.

        India‚Äôs climate is largely tropical but varies significantly due to its diverse geography. The northern Himalayas experience alpine and tundra climates with heavy snowfall in winters. The Indo-Gangetic plains have a subtropical climate with hot summers, cold winters, and seasonal monsoon rains. Central India and the Deccan Plateau experience semi-arid and tropical wet-dry climates. Western deserts like the Thar experience extremely high temperatures in summer and very low rainfall. Coastal regions enjoy tropical wet climate with moderate temperatures and high humidity. The southwest monsoon, occurring from June to September, brings the majority of annual rainfall, critical for agriculture and water resources. India‚Äôs climate influences agriculture, water supply, biodiversity, and urban planning. Extreme weather events such as cyclones, floods, and heatwaves are common challenges. Seasonal variations also affect festivals, cultural events, and daily life. Regional climates shape crop patterns, clothing, architecture, and settlement patterns across the country.
